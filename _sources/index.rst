Chem 193: (ML :math:`\cup` MD) :math:`\cap` Biophysics
======================================================

**Description:** This course is an introduction to **machine learning (ML)**, **molecular dynamics (MD)**, and their application to solve **biophysical problems**. 
The course is designed for students with a background in chemistry, physics, biology or computer science who are interested in learning how to use computational tools to solve biophysical problems.
The course will cover the basics of ML and MD, and their application to important biophysical problems such as protein structure prediction, understanding protein folding and computational drug design among others.
The course will include lectures covering theory, hands-on tutorials showcasing specific applications and programming assignments. 
The course will be taught in Python and will use popular libraries such as Numpy, SciPy, PyTorch, JAX and OpenMM.

**Prerequisites:** thermodynamics (Chem 31 or equivalent), organic chemistry (Chem 51 or equivalent), linear algebra (Math 70 or equivalent), and basis programming skills.

**Instructor:** Dr. Xinqiang Ding (Xinqiang.Ding@tufts.edu)

**Time and Location:** Tuesday and Thursday 10:30-11:45am, Pearson 112
